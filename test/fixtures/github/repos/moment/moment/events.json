I mean, how could it ever work? Surely, you don't think that in the absence of day information that 3:30 AM is after 6:00 PM...The problem is that you have some extra context that Moment doesn't have, which is that the `endTime` is expected to be after the `startTime`; that's obvious from your variable names, but Moment doesn't and can't. You'll have to tell it.\r\n\r\nSo how about this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (startTime.isAfter(endTime)){\r\n  endTime.add(1, 'days');\r\n}\r\n```"

The more indirect types are used, the more the user doesn't know what is actually a possible value for an argument.\n\n``` ts\nfunction(a: number): void;\nfunction(a: string): void;\n\n// vs\n\ntype X = number | string;\nfunction(a: X);\n```\n- is there a good way to declare what has been deprecated in comments\n- can you pull things out of a namespace (like using std::sort in C++ to pull out sort out of std and make it usable with namespace prefix).\n\n@blakeembrey @gdi2290 @Guria\n",
