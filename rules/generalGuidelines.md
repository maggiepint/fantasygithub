Open Source Fantasy League (OSFL) is a social platform where individual managers can assemble a team of open source projects which score points based on activity (code commits, pull requests, documentation, issue fixes, etc.). The goal is to pick projects which contribute positively to the ongoing health of open source software, thus scoring more than other friends/managers who picked different projects.

# Social Goals

* Be a constructive force for positivity, diversity, and participation in writing, maintaining, documenting, and promoting open source software.
* Recognize both momentary contributions (such as creating a single issue or pull request) and long term consistency (contribution to a project over months or years)

# Leagues
* `Leagues` are made up of 7-10 teams, each with a ``manager``.
* All `leagues` must have a ``comissioner``. The ``commissioner`` sets the rule options for the league,
and is responsible for facilitating day-to-day activity of the league, and its draft.
* `Commissioners` may create and maually enforce `house rules` for any `league`. This is part of the fun.
* `Leagues` draft players in snake format, similar to most fantasy sports drafts.
* `Leagues` may choose to do auction drafts as well, but this is not part of our initial software POC

# Season
* `Comissioners` may define a fantasy `season` of 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, etc.
* `Comissioners` may define a fantasy head-to-head `playoffs`.

# Format
* `Leagues` may play in weekly head-to-head or points format
