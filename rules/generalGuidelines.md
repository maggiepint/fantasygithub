# Leagues
* `Leagues` are made up of 7-10 teams, each with a ``manager``.
* All `leagues` must have a ``comissioner``. The ``commissioner`` sets the rule options for the league,
and is responsible for facilitating day-to-day activity of the league, and its draft.
* `Commissioners` may create and maually enforce `house rules` for any `league`. This is part of the fun.
* `Leagues` draft players in snake format, similar to most fantasy sports drafts.
* `Leagues` may choose to do auction drafts as well, but this is not part of our initial software POC

# Season
* `Comissioners` may define a fantasy `season` of 1 week, 4 weeks, or 12 weeks

# Format
* `Leagues` may play in head-to-head or points format

# Teams

* `Managers` draft entire open source `Projects` instead of individuals. This keeps the focus positive, provides the potential for more action every day (it would be boring to see a day pass without any new stats), and helps to promote open source projects.
